  <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
  <p><strong>Respect Rica</strong> was born from our time in Costa Rica, where we saw firsthand the beauty of its land, culture, and people—but also the harm caused by unaware tourism. From sunscreen chemicals hurting coral reefs to food waste and disrespect for local customs, we realized travelers need more than a guidebook.</p>
  <p>Our mission is to educate tourists and young learners on how to experience Costa Rica mindfully. Through social media, kid-friendly workshops, and interactive tools, we promote sustainable travel, cultural respect, and safety awareness, while empowering visitors to tread lightly and leave a positive impact.</p>
  <h2>Why Respect Rica?</h2>
  <p>Respect Rica is a youth-led project based in Costa Rica that helps people travel more mindfully—without losing the magic of discovery. We focus on protecting the coast, respecting local culture, and making tourism safer and more meaningful for everyone. Through educational tools, creative outreach, and bilingual resources, we guide kids, families, and visitors toward more conscious choices.</p>
  <h2>🌟 About the Creators</h2>
  <p>One of the creators of this project is Joanna Zhou, a high school student and eco-advocate who traveled to Costa Rica through a sustainability program. Moved by the beauty of the coast—and the impact of careless tourism, she launched Respect Rica to inspire mindful travel, starting with youth education. Joanna is passionate about science, culture, storytelling, and making a difference. Her goal is to help tourists of all ages experience Costa Rica in a way that protects its people, nature, and pura vida spirit.This site is just the beginning. ♡</p>
  <p>Hola! I’m <strong>Maria Belen</strong>, a rising Bolivian senior student, dancer, and co-creator behind Respect Rica. After a trip to Costa Rica, where I was able to admire its beautiful flora and fauna, I realized that tourists don’t always take proper care when visiting the ocean. That’s why I built this project with Joanna—to help educate visitors on how to protect Costa Rica’s seas. This website is a blend of education, tech, and above all, heart—for all the incredible wonders this country has to offer.</p>

 <h3>🌊 Coral Reefs 101</h3>
<p>Coral reefs are underwater ecosystems made of tiny animals called coral polyps. These reefs support over 25% of all marine life and protect coastlines from waves and storms. In Costa Rica, reefs like those near Cahuita National Park are home to colorful fish, sea turtles, and even sharks!</p>
<p>But coral reefs are in danger. Rising ocean temperatures, pollution, and toxic chemicals—especially from non-reef-safe sunscreen—cause bleaching and death of coral.</p>

<h3>🇨🇷 Costa Rican Culture Tips</h3>
<ul>
  <li>“Pura Vida” isn’t just a phrase—it means appreciating life, being kind, and slowing down.</li>
  <li>Always greet locals with “¡Hola!” or “Buenos días.”</li>
  <li>Support local artisans instead of mass-produced souvenirs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>📋 Tourist Do’s and Don’ts</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>DO</strong> wear reef-safe sunscreen and reusable water bottles.</li>
  <li><strong>DON’T</strong> touch or feed wildlife—it stresses them out and is often illegal.</li>
  <li><strong>DO</strong> learn a few Spanish phrases—it goes a long way!</li>
  <li><strong>DON’T</strong> litter or take home seashells or sand—it damages ecosystems.</li>
</ul>

<h3>🛟 Staying Safe in Costa Rica</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Only swim where there are lifeguards. Rip currents are dangerous!</li>
  <li>Wear shoes when hiking—some animals hide in the brush.</li>
  <li>Be careful near waterfalls—they’re slippery and powerful.</li>
</ul>

<h3>⚠️ Scams & What to Avoid</h3>
<ul>
  <li>If prices aren’t posted, ask before you pay.</li>
  <li>Only take official taxis (red with a yellow triangle) or rideshare apps.</li>
  <li>Be wary of fake tour guides—use licensed services from hotels or trusted sites.</li>
</ul>

<h3>📞 Emergency Numbers in Costa Rica</h3>
<ul>
  <li>911 – General Emergency</li>
  <li>128 – Red Cross</li>
  <li>118 – Coast Guard</li>
  <li>800-TURISMO – Tourist Assistance Line (English-speaking)</li>
</ul>

<h3>🌺 Bonus Facts About Costa Rica</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Nearly 25% of Costa Rica is protected land or national park!</li>
  <li>Costa Rica has no standing army—peace is part of its culture.</li>
  <li>It’s home to over 500,000 species, including sloths, jaguars, and scarlet macaws.</li>
</ul>


  <h3>📓 Mini Blog #1: Why Pura Vida Isn’t Just a Phrase</h3>
  <p>You hear it the second you land. Maybe from your taxi driver. Maybe from a barista handing you pineapple juice in a paper straw cup. Maybe from someone waving at you from a hammock. It’s strung along t-shirts in tourist shops like a welcome and traded from one local to another like a greeting.
  <br><br>“Pura vida,” they say. Suddenly, it’s in the air.
  <br><br>At first, you might think it's just the Costa Rican way of saying “hello” or “all good,” but the more you hear it, the more you realize: rather than a phrase, it’s a whole vibe, a way of seeing the world. “Pura Vida” is a soft, sun-drenched philosophy wrapped in two simple words.
  <br><br>It can mean: “Life is messy, but let’s smile anyway.”
  <br>It can mean: “The waves are big, but so are you.”
  <br>It can mean: “Be kind, be grateful, and don’t forget to notice the color of the sky.”
  <br><br>In Costa Rica, Pura Vida isn’t simply performative. It’s in how people hold doors open or wait for a sloth to cross the road without honking. It’s in the quiet patience of fishermen and the easy laughter of kids running barefoot near the tide.
  <br><br>So yeah, you can buy a tote bag with Pura Vida on it. But long after your tan has faded, remember that the real magic is in practicing it.
  <br><br>Pura Vida doesn’t mean “perfect life.” It means “pure life.” And that is so much better.</p>

  <h2>For Kids</h2>
  <p><strong>Kids Workbook:</strong> <a href="https://www.canva.com/design/DAGtQK-etso/mAjVZio4jTZsAcalaYfBQA/edit?utm_content=DAGtQK-etso&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton" target="_blank">Click here to open the full Eco-Heroes Workbook</a></p>
  <h3>🌿 3 Fun Eco-Hero Experiments & Activities for Kids</h3>
  <p><strong>Bonus Lessons Beyond the Workbook</strong><br><strong>Age Range:</strong> 8–12<br><strong>Theme:</strong> Hands-on learning about ocean health, sustainability, and Costa Rica’s environment</p>

  <p><strong>🧪 1. DIY Ocean Acidification Lab (With Vinegar & Shells)</strong><br>Goal: Understand how CO₂ and acid affect marine life like coral and shells.<br><br>
  <em>You’ll Need:</em><br>
  2 small clear cups<br>
  Vinegar<br>
  Tap water<br>
  A few small seashells, coral fragments, or eggshells<br>
  A marker or labels<br><br>
  <em>Instructions:</em><br>
  Label one cup “Ocean” and fill it with water. Label the other “Acid Ocean” and fill it with vinegar.<br>
  Place the same amount of shell in both cups.<br>
  Observe the shells daily for 3 days. What changes? Look for fizzing or weakening.<br><br>
  <em>What’s Happening?</em> Vinegar is acidic—just like oceans are becoming due to CO₂ pollution. This experiment shows how acidity can slowly dissolve calcium carbonate in shells and coral.</p>

  <p><strong>🥗 2. Leftover Chef: Turn Waste into Wins</strong><br>Goal: Rethink food waste and turn it into something tasty.<br><br>
  <em>You’ll Need:</em><br>
  Leftovers from lunch (like rice, beans, tortillas, veggies)<br>
  Optional: eggs, cheese, salsa<br>
  Adult help + a stove or microwave<br>
  A notebook or phone to take a “recipe photo”<br><br>
  <em>Instructions:</em><br>
  Have kids look through clean leftovers and create a new meal or snack (like a rice scramble or veggie quesadilla).<br>
  Name the dish and take a photo.<br>
  Discuss what would’ve happened if that food was thrown out.<br><br>
  <em>What’s Happening?</em> Food waste contributes to climate change. In Costa Rica, tourists waste 40% more than locals. This activity shows how we can reduce waste and be creative.</p>

  <p><strong>🐬 3. Plastic Detective Beach Audit</strong><br>Goal: Observe and record plastic pollution like a real eco-researcher.<br><br>
  <em>You’ll Need:</em><br>
  Pencil & notebook or printed log sheet<br>
  Gloves (optional but helpful)<br>
  Trash bag<br>
  Access to a local beach, trail, or park<br><br>
  <em>Instructions:</em><br>
  Spend 15 minutes collecting and categorizing trash: bottle caps, wrappers, plastic bags, etc.<br>
  Count how many plastic items you found.<br>
  Graph the data or draw a trash map of what you saw most.<br><br>
  <em>What’s Happening?</em> This simulates what real scientists do during pollution surveys. Kids see firsthand how much trash ends up in nature—and feel empowered to do something about it.</p>

  <p><strong>🌟 Bonus Prompt: Eco-Invention Sketch</strong><br>Have students brainstorm and draw a tool they would invent to help the ocean—like a robot crab that eats plastic or a coral-healing snorkel!</p>

  <h3>🌴 Mini Blog #2: What Tourists Often Get Wrong About Costa Rica</h3>
<p><strong>Exploring Costa Rica’s lush forests, dramatic coastlines, and vibrant culture is a dream for many. Yet misconceptions often color travelers’ expectations. Here’s what you should actually know before your trip.</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>🇨🇷 “Costa Rica is an island or a U.S. territory”</strong><br>False. Costa Rica is a sovereign Central American country, bordered by Nicaragua and Panama—not an island like Puerto Rico, nor part of the U.S.</li>
  <li><strong>💸 “It’s super cheap—like other Central American countries”</strong><br>Not necessarily. Costa Rica’s living costs are much closer to the U.S. or Hawaii, especially in tourism-heavy zones.</li>
  <li><strong>🦟 “You’ll get malaria or dengue nonstop”</strong><br>Not true. Malaria is rare. Dengue exists but can be prevented with repellent and care.</li>
  <li><strong>🚗 “All the roads are terrible”</strong><br>Mixed truth. Major highways are decent, but rural roads can be rough. Avoid night driving if possible.</li>
  <li><strong>🌦️ “Dry season = always sunny”</strong><br>Microclimates make weather unpredictable. Dry season (Dec–April) varies, especially near the Caribbean coast.</li>
  <li><strong>🦈 “Shark attacks are a big worry”</strong><br>Very rare. You’re more likely to spot a crocodile in river mouths than sharks in the sea.</li>
  <li><strong>🥗 “You can’t eat local fruits or juices”</strong><br>That’s outdated. In most places, local produce and juices are perfectly safe and delicious!</li>
  <li><strong>🛡️ “Costa Rica isn’t safe”</strong><br>Relatively safe. Petty theft is the main concern—watch valuables, especially in cities or on beaches.</li>
  <li><strong>🌐 “It lacks modern infrastructure”</strong><br>Not true. Cities have solid Wi-Fi, hospitals, Uber, and more. Just know rural areas differ.</li>
  <li><strong>🌿 “Ecotourism means environmental innocence”</strong><br>It helps—but also brings issues like overcrowding, pollution, and strain on small ecosystems.</li>
</ol>

<h4>✨ Beyond the Myths: Things You’ll Love</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Wildlife diversity:</strong> Over 500,000 species—5% of global biodiversity.</li>
  <li><strong>Local food:</strong> Try gallo pinto, tropical fruits, and fresh seafood.</li>
  <li><strong>Unexpected gaps:</strong> “Suicide showers” (electric heaters) still exist—check wiring!</li>
</ul>
